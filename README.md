## Projects

### 1. [Control loop underactuated 2DOF](./Control_loop_underactuated_2DOF)
**Description:**  
A model of an underactuated 2 degrees of freedom (2DOF) system. The goal of this project was to design and simulate a control loop for such a system using PID controller as feedback and servo-constraints in feedforward part.

### 2. [Control loop Quanser underactuated with ADRC regulator](./Control_loop_Quanser_ADRC)
**Description:**  
This project involves implementing a control loop using the ADRC (Active Disturbance Rejection Control) regulator for a real Quanser underactuated system.


---

### 3. [ADRC tuning for Quanser](./ADRC_tuning_Quanser)
**Description:**  
This project focuses on tuning the parameters of an ADRC regulator for the Quanser system to ensure stable performance under varying initial conditions and disturbances.

### 4. [ROS2 manipulator](./ROS2)
**Description:**
This project realizes simple inverse kinematics for serial manipulator.
