\# Control loop underactuated 2DOF



\## Description

This project focuses on designing a control loop for an underactuated system with 2 degrees of freedom. The system exhibits nonlinear behavior and limited control inputs, making it a challenging control task.



\## Objectives

\- Model the 2DOF underactuated system

\- Design and simulate the control strategy

\- Analyze the stability and performance of the system



\## Technologies Used

\- MATLAB

\- Simulink



\## Results

Ready control loop with tuned PID controllers.
