# Control Loop for Underactuated 2DOF System

## 🧾 Description
This project focuses on designing a control loop for an underactuated system with 2 degrees of freedom (2DOF).  
The system exhibits nonlinear behavior and limited control inputs, making it a challenging control task.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Model the underactuated 2DOF system  
- Design and simulate the control strategy  
- Analyze the stability and performance of the system  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- MATLAB  
- Simulink  

## ✅ Results
A ready-to-use control loop with tuned PID controllers has been developed and tested.
