# Simple inverse kinematics for serial manipulator

## 🧾 Description

This project takes on basic ROS2 solutions, where inverse kinematics task is solved for 3DOF serial manipulator given end-effector point.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Create 3D model for manipulator
* Solve inverse kinematics task

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* ROS2
* RVizz

## ✅ Results



3D model which reaches end point and solves inverse kinematics task.
