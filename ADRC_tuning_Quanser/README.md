# Tuning ADRC Controller for an Underactuated Quanser System

## 📄 Description

This project focuses on tuning an Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) controller using a brute-force approach.  
The controller's bandwidth and critical gain were tested within the ranges \[10⁻⁵; 1] and \[1; 10⁵], respectively.

## 🎯 Objective

- Select optimal ADRC parameters to minimize tracking error  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- MATLAB  
- Simulink  

## ✅ Results

The ADRC controller was successfully tuned using the brute-force method.  
The results of this work are presented in a paper that is currently being prepared for submission to a high-impact scientific journal.
