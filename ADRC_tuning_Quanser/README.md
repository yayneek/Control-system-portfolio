\# Tuning ADRC controller for Quanser underactuated



\## Description

This project revolves around tuning ADRC controller using brute force approach. Controller bandwidth and critical gain were tested in range \[10^(-5); 1] and \[1; 10^5] respectively. 



\## Objectives

\- Select ADRC settings to minimize tracking error



\## Technologies Used

\- MATLAB

\- Simulink



\## Results

ADRC controller tuned using brute force approach. Results of this work are presented in the paper which will be submitted to a high-impact journal. First page of this work is attached in the files below.
