\# Control loop underactuated Quanser ADRC



\## Description

This project focuses on development of control loop for underactuated Quanser robot. As feedback ADRC is used. To solve inverse dynamics for underactuated multibody system, servo-constraints is applied. 



\## Objectives

\- Model the geometrical and servo constraints

\- Design and simulate the whole process

\- Analyze accuracy and quality of the developed system



\## Technologies Used

\- MATLAB

\- Simulink



\## Results

As a result for this project ready control system for complex underactuated multibody system. With given end-point, trajectory is realised.
